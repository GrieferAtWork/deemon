# deemon - Deemon scripting language

Deemon, completely rewritten with a new focus on clean, intuitive and function language design, while still maintaining a backwards compatibility rate high enough to allow for simply porting of existing code.
For more information on changes, fixes and improvements, see /lib/LANGUAGE.txt

### Major improvements
  - Introduction of a module-based dependency system that allows code reuse without relying on preprocessor functionality that really didn't fit a scripting language all too well.
  - With more emphasis on documentation, deemon now comes shipped with a documentation server accessing via web-browser
    - Links listed below require that you are running
  - A complete overhaul of the builtin `string' (http://localhost:8080/modules/net/deemon/string)
    - Full unicode support all packed together into a single string type
    - Separation between raw data (http://localhost:8080/modules/net/deemon/bytes) and strings, as well as functionality to decode/encode data and strings
    - Builtin support for regular expressions
    - Addition of miscellaneous functions such as <code>indent()</code> or <code>findmatch()</code> to help in situation where the old string type was striggling
    - Addition of case-insensitive variants of many functions, such as <code>casefind()</code>
  - Introduction of a common base class for any sequence-like type http://localhost:8080/modules/net/deemon/sequence
    - Includes emulation of any kind of sequence operator, as well as a huge set of member functions, including <code>find()</code>, <code>sum()</code>, <code>operator add</code> or comparisons
    - Also introduce common base classes for set-like, and mapping-like objects
  - Introduction of ASP (Abstract Sequence Proxy)-like objects allows for lazy computation in functions like <code>string.split()</code>, distributing work load across usage and essentially making such functions O(1) when invoked
  - Introduction of default, optional and named arguments for user-functions
    - <code>function foo(a,b = 10,c?)</code>
    - <code>add(x: 10, y: 20)</code>
  - Introduction of a same-object / different-object operator <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>
  - Introduction of a new syntax for constructing super-view <code>foo() as sequence</code>
  - Introduction of a new syntax for checking if variables or attributes are bound <code>if (x is bound) print x;</code>
  - Introduction of <code>with</code>-statements, useful when dealing with files or synchronization primitives
    - To go alongside, 2 new operator <code>operator enter</code> and <code>operator leave</code> were introduced
  - Introduction of an interactive excution mode <code>deemon -i</code> where code is executed as it is generated
  - Introduction of a <code>deepcopy</code> keyword and operator to go alongside the <code>copy</code> keyword
    - Also includes automatic tracking of recursive objects such as a list containing itself.
  - Added support for raw string literals <code>r"the following are 2 characters: \n"</code>
  - Overhaul of exception handlers in user-code introducing zero-effort handlers (as opposed to some stack of active handlers)
  - Overhaul of user-classes now require member variables to also be declared, significantly improving runtime performance
  - Lazy compilation of module source files into pre-compiled file caches improves load time significantly
  - Very powerful peephole optimization of generated bytecode
  - The bytecode now generated by deemon has grown so powerful that you can actually write code using it (also included is a powerful disassembler)
    - If you look at it, it really has more in common with that of a CISC architecture, featuring admirable compression rates, while still executing quite fast
  - Added compiler warnings for various questionable cases (including use of reserved keywords as symbol names)
  - I took the time to write the entire interpreter in i386 assembly (by hand), providing a significant performance boost on 32-bit intel machines.

### Noteworthy changes and fixes
  - Inplace operators have significantly different operation protocols that regular operators (<code>x += y;</code> is emulated as <code>x = x + y;</code> at runtime when no inplace operator exists)
  - Clases now require the user to declare member variables (also: I actually implemented a syntax for super-initialization in constructors)
  - Introduction of new symbol classes for extern (aka. imported) and global (aka. exported) objects
    - Global variables are created when defining a symbols without <code>local</code> prefix in the global scope, or explicitly when prefixed with <code>global</code>
    - Global variables can be modified by other modules, or by functions without the need of placing their values inside of a cell
  - The style guidelines now discourage the use of underscores in symbol names (e.g. it's <code>seq.nonempty()</code> instead of <code>seq.non_empty()</code>, which is deprecated)
  - Builtin types such as <code>list</code> or <code>dict</code> must now be <code>import * from deemon;</code>-ed before they appear as symbols
  - The builtin type <code>set</code> has been renamed to <code>hashset</code>. <code>set from deemon</code> is now the base-class for set-like objects
    - Shouldn't really cause any problems in old code though, because deemon 100+'s <code>set</code>-type has always been broken, and never got fixed
  - The builtin <code>set</code> object (now called <code>hashset</code>) actually works
  - Not every object can be weakly referenced now, and instead of a dedicated keyword <code>weak</code>, <code>weakref from deemon</code> is used to construct weak references
  - Single-element tuples can now be constructed as <code>(foo,)</code>
  - While deemon 100's compiler configuration handled pretty much any syntax problem with a warning, deemon 200 is default-configured to produce errors, thus preventing faulty code from accidentally being executed

### Noteworthy maintained features (that will stay)
  - Inplace soruce formatting <code>deemon -F</code>
  - <code>pack</code>-expressions to omit parenthesis (<code>foo pack 10,20</code> is the same as <code>foo(10,20)</code>)
  - A fully featured C preprocessor (it's a highly advanced version of tpp, including all of its extensions)
  - The <code>\_\_nth</code> keyword being used to select secondary variable matches.

### Deprecated features (discouraged usage, but continued maintainance)
  - <code>#include \<...\></code> You really shouldn't be including files any more. - Use modules instead (they're way better)
  - Various minor syntax changes to steer usercode to before more uniform (warned about in new code; ignored in legacy code)
  - The dedicated syntax for cells (<code>\<foo\></code> is deprecated and not encouraged)
    - Use <code>cell from deemon</code> instead.

### Dropped features
  - C-emulation of <code>struct</code>, <code>extern</code>, <code>union</code>, etc.
    - The runtime-aspect is still available through ctypes (http://localhost:8080/modules/ctypes), however don't have a dedicated syntax any more
    - Maintained C-like features that won't go away:
      - C-like casts <code>(int)x</code> (same as <code>int(x)</code>)
      - C-like variable declarations <code>int x = y;</code> (same as <code>local x = int(y);</code>)
  - <code>alias</code>-symbol declarations no longer exist
  - <code>const</code>-symbol declarations no longer exist (optimization automatically detects <code>local</code> variables written only once as constant)
  - <code>operator !</code> has been removed, and <code>!foo</code> invokes <code>operator bool</code> and logically inverts its result
  - The <code>operator move()</code> constructor has been removed, as well as the <code>move</code> keyword.
  - Removed the logical XOR operator <code>^^</code> (just cast both operands to bool, then use the regular XOR)

### Dropped features that are emulated in legacy code
Legacy code being detected by it #including any of the old headers
  - C-like syntax for attributes <code>\_\_attribute\_\_((attrib))</code>, <code>\_\_declspec(attrib)</code>, <code>[[attrib]]</code>
    - Deemon 200 relies less than ever on attributes, and where they are useful, tags are used <code>@attrib</code>
    - Note that tags will likely undergo their own overhaul in the near future in order to user-code to define its own tags
  - The millions of <code>\_\_builtin*</code> functions have all been removed
    - Most notable, even <code>\_\_builtin\_object()</code> is emulated
  - Removed the <code>weak</code> keyword
  - Various keywords that all start with 2 underscores (<code>__static_if</code>, <code>__if_true</code>, etc.)

## Known problems
While the core compiles fine under linux, dex modules don't.
I havn't yet figured out how to get an ELF shared library to link against a statically linked executable's dynamic symbol table. Deemon 100 didn't run into this problem because it had the core be a shared library, too, which I'm not going to do because dynamically relocating the core at runtime would be \_way\_ too expensive due to the enourmous number of pointers between static structures.
On Windows everything is pre-linked at a fixed address, and linking against executables is just as simple as linking against libraries, and I had no problems getting it to work.
