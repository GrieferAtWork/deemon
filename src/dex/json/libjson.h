 * === JSON SUPPORT                                                                    ===
 * =======================================================================================
 *
 * The JSON dex provides the following functions:
 * >> #define JSONObject (float | int | string | bool | none | Sequence | Mapping)
 * >> function parse(data: File | Bytes | string | Mapping): JSONObject;
 * >> function parse(data: File | Bytes | string | Mapping, into: Object): Object;
 * >> function parse(data: File | Bytes | string | Mapping, into: Type): Object;
 * >> function write(data: Object | JSONObject, pretty: bool = false): string;
 * >> function write(data: Object | JSONObject, into: File, pretty: bool = false): File;
 *
 * Notes:
 * - When `parse(data)' returns a Sequence of Mapping, JSON input data may not be
 *   fully validated, as the returned sequences are allowed to be abstract sequence
 *   types that only parse JSON input as it is requested via sequence operations.
 *   In order to force evaluation of JSON input, you can cast the result to another
 *   type of sequence which will then force evaluation (just like with all other
 *   sequence proxy types)
 * - When given a `Mapping', `parse' behaves the same as though `json.write(data)'
 *   was given instead (iow: it will treat the contents of the mapping as a parsed
 *   JSON object and either re-return the mapping, or write its elements to `into')
 * - `parse' will decode JSON blobs into JSONObject-types as would be expected,
 *   but if given an `into' object, it will parse a JSON-object and fill in all
 *   of that object's attributes as attributes of `into'. Also note that when
 *   members of `into' have type annotations, decode will parse those annotations
 *   and construct instances of the referenced objects, as well as assert that the
 *   proper types are provided for simple JSON types. (Note that where there are no
 *   type annotations, or `Object' is annotated, *any* type of JSON attribute can
 *   be set)
 *   >> import * from deemon;
 *   >> import json;
 *   >> class Inner {
 *   >>     public member x: int;
 *   >>     public member y: int;
 *   >> }
 *   >> class Outer {
 *   >>     public member inner: Inner;
 *   >>     public member z: string;
 *   >> }
 *   >> local x = json.parse('{"inner":{x:10,y:20},z:"Foo"}', Outer);
 *   >> print repr x; // Outer(inner: Inner(x: 10, y: 20), z: "Foo")
 *   >> json.parse('{z:42}', Outer); // Throws a TypeError
 *   - Note that for this purpose, Tuple type descriptions expected JSON input
 *     to offer arrays of matching length, and matching order. Also note that in
 *     case of multiple possible types, all provided types are tried in order,
 *     and the first one that doesn't result in a parser error is then used.
 * - `parse(File)' is the same as `parse(File.readall())', as in: there is no
 *   way to only parse a single JSON object from a file and leave the file's
 *   pointer such that it points directly after the JSON object.
 * - `parse(data, Type)' is the same as `parse(data, Type())',
 * - Only `public' members of DTOs will be initialized by `parse'
 * - `write' will encode JSONObject-types as would be expected, and all other
 *   objects are treated as DTOs and have their attributes enumerated and then
 *   written to the output file.
 * - Under the hood, the JSON dex uses a port of KOS's libjson system library
 * - Fun fact: with the exception of needing to write `none' instead of `null',
 *   deemon is actually syntactically compatible with JSON, and if you were to
 *   write `global final null = none;', it would be fully compatible!
 *   As such, technically speaking all functionality provided by this dex is
 *   also already available by `_jit' (and `deemon.exec()'), though it should
 *   be obvious that *executing as code* would be a security risk in case you
 *   received the json-blob from an untrusted source (or really *any source*
 *   for that matter).
