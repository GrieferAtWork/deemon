/* Tell sqlite3 that we do our own locking (with blackjack & hookers)
 * Reason: The way that sqlite3 does locking, there is a situation where
 *         DeeThread_Wake() will be unable to interrupt certain threads:
 * - Thread #1: holding lock to DB mutex, and in long-running query
 * - Thread #2: trying to acquire lock to DB mutex
 * - Thread #3: Sends interrupt to Thread #2
 * - Thread #2: Unable to receive interrupt because sqlite3's mutex can't indicate interrupts
 *
 * Solution: can't rely on sqlite3's mutex code -- must do our
 *           own and compile sqlite3 with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=2 */
