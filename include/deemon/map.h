/* Base class for mapping-style sequence types (e.g. `Dict')
 * :: Characteristics of a mapping type::
 *   - operator iter():
 *     sequence item through iteration yields another
 *     sequence consisting of 2 elements: `key' = `value'
 *     This sub-sequence is usually often implemented as a tuple,
 *     and code should be optimized for that code, however this
 *     is not a requirement.
 *   - The getitem operator is implemented as a lookup-key
 *     function that returns the associated value.
 *     A missing key causes a `KeyError' to be thrown.
 *   - The getrange operator is not implemented.
 *
 * Using `Mapping from deemon' (aka. `DeeMapping_Type') as a base class, it will
 * automatically provide for the following member functions and operators:
 *   - `operator getrange()'
 *      - Always thrown a NotImplement error, overriding `sequence.operator getrange'.
 *   - `operator | (other: Mapping): Mapping'
 *   - `operator & (other: Mapping): Mapping'
 *      - Returns a mapping consisting of the union, or intersection of keys from `this' and `other'
 *   - `operator contains(key: Object): bool'
 *      - Returns `true' / `false' indicative of there being a key-item pair for `key'
 *   - `operator tp_repr() -> string'
 *      - Returns a representation of the contents of the mapping,
 *        following the generic-mapping syntax of `{ key: item, ... }'
 *   - `class member Proxy: Type'
 *      - Returns the common base-class of `keys', `values' and `items'
 *        By default, this is `DeeMappingProxy_Type'
 *   - `class member Keys: Type'
 *      - Returns the return type of the `keys' member property
 *        By default, this is `DeeMappingKeys_Type'
 *   - `class member Values: Type'
 *      - Returns the return type of the `values' member property
 *        By default, this is `DeeMappingValues_Type'
 *   - `class member Items: Type'
 *      - Returns the return type of the `items' member property
 *        By default, this is `DeeMappingItems_Type'
 *   - `property keys: Mapping.Keys'
 *      - Returns a sequence that can be enumerated to view only the keys of a mapping
 *   - `property values: Mapping.Values'
 *      - Returns a sequence that can be enumerated to view only the values of a mapping
 *   - `property items: Mapping.Items'
 *      - Returns a sequence that can be enumerated to view the key-item pairs as
 *        2-element sequences, the same way they could be viewed if the mapping itself
 *        was being iterated.
 *        Note however that the returned object is a pure sequence, meaning that it
 *        implements an index-based getitem operator, as well as a getrange operator.
 *   - `function get(key: Object, def: Object = none): Object'
 *      - Same as `operator []', but if `key' doesn't exist, `def' is returned instead.
 * NOTE: `DeeMapping_Type' itself is derived from `Sequence from deemon' (aka. `DeeSeq_Type')
 * NOTE: Because `DeeMapping_Type' inherits from `DeeSeq_Type', all member functions that
 *       it provides, as well as its operators (such as `bool', compare, etc.), are
 *       implicitly inherited, and also provided by objects derived from `DeeMapping_Type',
 *       and `Mapping from deemon' itself.
 *       This also means that sub-classes of `Mapping from deemon' should respect the
 *       iterator interface, provided a `class member Iterator: Type' which represents
 *       the iterator type used by the mapping. */
