 * Constructor/repr parameters are ordered the same as struct members are, with
 * members from base classes coming first, but being allowed to be skipped if
 * a relevant sub-class defines a different name:
 * - the name used for the attribute at some offset is always the first attribute
 *   name encountered during MRO resolution.
 * - Attributes are ordered in reverse MRO resolution order.
 *
 * WARNING: The following struct types CANNOT be used (since they require initialization
 *          which isn't supported by `DeeStructObject_*' which requires that all fields
 *          be optional):
 * - "STRUCT_OBJECT"      (use "STRUCT_OBJECT_OPT" instead)
 * - "STRUCT_WOBJECT"     (use "STRUCT_WOBJECT_OPT" instead)
 * - "STRUCT_CSTR"        (owner wouldn't be reference; use "STRUCT_OBJECT" instead)
 * - "STRUCT_CSTR_OPT"    (owner wouldn't be reference; use "STRUCT_OBJECT" instead)
 * - "STRUCT_CSTR_EMPTY"  (owner wouldn't be reference; use "STRUCT_OBJECT" instead)
 * - "STRUCT_STRING"      (impossible to know max-length; use "STRUCT_OBJECT" instead)
