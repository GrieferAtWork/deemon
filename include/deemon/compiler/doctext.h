 * Output:
 *    "(:?Dint)->?Dint\nMy Documentation text"
 *
 * The user-visible doc portion here is "My Documentation text", as already seen
 * in the original source code. However, it's not quite as simple as that, since
 * documentation strings may contain a number of special formating indicators.
 * This form of the documentation text is called "Fully Encoded"
 *
 * First off, before any additional formating is done, Encoded Documentation Texts
 * to-be embedded within __doc__ strings are escaped as follows in order to turn
 * them info Fully Encoded Documentation Texts:
 *  #1 Any instance of \ is replaced with \\
 *     >> replace("\\", "\\\\");
 *  #2 Multiple consecutive line-feeds (i.e. sequences of at least 1 empty line) are
 *     escaped such that every \n-character except for the first is prefixed by \:
 *     >> ...
 *     >> replace("\n\n\n\n", "\n\\\n\\\n\\\n");
 *     >> replace("\n\n\n",   "\n\\\n\\\n");
 *     >> replace("\n\n",     "\n\\\n");
 *  #3 Any line that starts with a (-character is escaped by inserting a \ at the
 *     start of the same line:
 *     >> replace("\n(", "\n\\(");
 *  #4 Any instance of -> is replaced with -\>:
 *     >> replace("->", "-\\>");
 *  #5 If the doc text stats with a \n-character, make it start with \\\n instead:
 *     >> if (startswith("\n")) this = "\\" + this;
 *
 * The resulting text is then appended after the documentation's declaration string,
 * the format of which is documented in `/include/deemon/compiler/symbol.h', with
 * an additional \n-character inserted inserted in-between.
 *
 * This encoding method can be reversed at runtime to re-gain the original documentation
 * text, the format of which will be described next, and who's encoding mechanism is
 * implemented within this file.
 *
 * Naming:
 *   - Fully Encoded Documentation Text:
 *         The raw strings found in __doc__ strings
 *
 *   - Encoded Documentation Text:
 *         This text's format is produced by compiling the "Raw Documentation Text",
 *         and encoding it using the the methods described in the section `ENCODING'
 *
 *   - Raw Documentation Text:
 *         The raw list of strings preceding some declaration in user-code
 *         after being stripped of each line's leading "@@", and joined by
 *         line-feeds ("\n".join(lines.each.lsstrip("@@")))
 *         This text's format is described in the next section `FORMAT'

 * +=============================================================================+
 *
 * This section details how "Raw Documentation Text" is compiled into "Encoded Documentation Text"
 *
 * Since this format is designed to compile from a human-readable documentation text format
 * into something that is easier parsed by tools such as `doc-browser.dee', this format is
 * designed with redundancy in mind.
 * This means that anything that would normally be considered a compiler error in a normal
 * compiler will instead cause anything that had already been specially encoded to be discarded,
 * before re-processing the original code of the failed component such that the outer-most
 * instance of the failed component will not be triggered, but will instead produce raw text.
 * e.g.:
 * >> +-----+--------------------+
 * >> | A   | B                  |
 * >> +-----+--------------------+
 * >> | @10 | @(int from deemon) |
 * >> +--------------------------+
 * This table is not well-formed (its footer is lacking a `+' where there is a `-' instead).
 * As such, the produced output text will not contain a table, but will instead contain the
 * raw +, - and | characters as they appear in this example the same way they would appear
 * if encoding tables in this form wasn't actually a feature of doc texts.
 * However, @10 and @(int from deemon) will still be encoded and high-lit properly, the later
 * also being clickable when the documentation string is viewed in `doc-browser.dee'.
 *
 * Any character that would be a controlling part of a special formating construct can be
 * prefixed by a \-character in order to disable the recognition of that construct, and have
 * the \-character be removed in the final output. When what follows a \-character isn't
 * actually a special construct start character, the \-character will not be removed, with
 * the exception of a \\-sequence, which will instead cause a single \-character to be written
 * to the Encoded Documentation Text output.
 *
 * As such, \ can be used to escape the following characters such that \ is removed,
 * and the escaped character looses any special meaning:
 *     \ _ @ ` [ ] ( ) - + | = ~ * # : >
 *
 *     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 .  (Only if the character appeared at the beginning of a line, or
 *                             was preceded by only other decimal, \, . or : characters (i.e.
 *                             would have been apart of a possibly already broken ordered list))
 *                             HINT: Any character matching `DeeUni_IsDecimal()' is considered
 *
 * Additionally, ' ' (or any other ) can be escaped to force the insertion of an additional
 * or specific space character.
 *
 * Lastly, since the @-character is also a vital part of Raw Documentation Text, it can also
 * be escaped in a variety of ways:
 *   - As already stated above, by causing a "compiler error" in the encoded expression that
 *     follows, the @-character can be escaped by something as simple as having it be followed
 *     by space, one of ')', '}', ']', '\', '`', ',', or a number of other characters that are
 *     not allowed to start an expression.
 *   - When written as \@, the already stated rule of using \ for escaping special formating
 *     constructs kicks in, causing a raw @-character to appear within the Encoded Documentation
 *     Text output
 *   - Lastly, you can write @@, which has the same effect as writing \@
 *
 *
 * A set of general raw text formating operations is performed in order to re-flow text into
 * a form that does not contain explicit line-feed at unintended locations:
 *
 *   - When taking the entirety of the "Raw Documentation Text", count the number of
 *     leading space characters for each non-empty line that also contains anything that
 *     isn't a space character, and take the lowest number from this set.
 *     If that number is non-zero, strip that many characters from every line before doing
 *     any additional processing:

 *     >> @@

 *   - Singular line-feeds are replaced by a single space-character

 *       - Unordered: each line beings with (the same) character, which is one of - + or *
 *     A list sequence is continuous starting with the first item, after which all following
 *     items must use the same ordering format (i.e. if the first item uses -, the next item
 *     must also use -, and can't just go ahead and use * or +). Additionally, if a list continues
 *     depends on the number of leading whitespace character of a following line, when compared to

 *         as part of the current (last) list item. - These empty lines should be parsed as part of

 *         meaning that the contained text may contain space characters, but must terminate
 *         on the same line.
 *       - START_OF_LINE + OPTIONAL_WHITESPACE + `>' (optionally repeated) is also pretty simple:
 *         line-feed followed by any number of >-characters (though at least one), with any line
 *         there-after that starts with the same number of >-characters also belonging to the same
 *         source representation block.
 *         The embedded code is also stripped for leading space characters common to all lines, such

 *         Note however that keywords in code such as this are not clickable, in that the compiler

 *       - ```deemon
 *         ...
 *         ```
 *         This one behaves the same as the previous one (`@@> ...'), in that it allows for deemon
 *         syntax highlighting within the eventual output. However, unlike the `@@> ...' form, this
 *         one allows the first line (containing "```deemon\n") to not appear at the start of its own
 *         line, and also unlike the `@@>...' form, this form strip leading and trailing whitespace
 *         from the embedded code, which also includes line-feeds.
 *         Note that forms such as "```deemon\n if (true) none;```" are also allowed, so-long as the
 *         "```deemon\n" portion is followed by at least 1 whitespace character, or a linefeed.
 *       - ```...```
 *         This form behaves the same as ```deemon\n...```, but doesn't include deemon-specific syntax

 *           @123. 4 Encoded as "```deemon\n123```. 4"  (except that no new-line is inserted)
 *         - A - or + followed by a digit:
 *           @-123    Encoded as "```deemon\n-123```"  (except that no new-line is inserted)
 *           @-123.   Encoded as "```deemon\n-123```."  (except that no new-line is inserted)
 *           @-123.4  Encoded as "```deemon\n-123.4```"  (except that no new-line is inserted)
 *           @-123. 4 Encoded as "```deemon\n-123```. 4"  (except that no new-line is inserted)
 *         - A keyword:
 *           @foo    Resolves to a clickable symbol `foo' in the context of the component
 *                   being annotated by the documentation text. Note that in the case of
 *                   a function, this also allows function arguments to be annotated!
 *           @foo()  Same a pure keyword, but annotate as a function-call
 *         - A ( [ or {-character:
 *           @(foo)          Same as `@foo'
 *           @(foo, bar)     A tuple expression (```deemon\n(foo, bar)```)
 *           @[foo]          An array expression (```deemon\n[foo]```)
 *           @{foo}          An sequence expression (```deemon\n{foo}```)
 *     In general, any deemon expression can be high-lit/annotated using this scheme, whilst
 *     also allowing keywords to be clicked in the associated representation, as well as making
 *     special provisioning for external symbol references to show up properly.
 *     This formating component is the one used most often and it's main purpose is to have code
 *     point at something particular that should be clickable for easy reference inside of text.

/* +=============================================================================+
 * | ENCODING (of compiled documentation text)                                   |
 * +=============================================================================+
 *
 * This section details how the compiled "Raw Documentation Text" is encoded
 * to form the "Encoded Documentation Text" that is then embedded in doc strings.
 *
 * All flow-text is encoded normally, with the exception that the following characters
 * are all escaped by being prefixed with a #-character, should they not be intended
 * as a special symbol used for encoding embedded format options.
 * All other characters are part of raw flow-text and will be encoded on a 1-on-1 basis.
 *
 * Characters that need escaping in raw text (by being prefixed by a #-character)
 *    # $ % & ~ ^ { } [ ] | ? * @ - + :
 *
 * Note that some of these characters aren't currently used by the encoding syntax,
 * however may find use in the future, so they already having to be escaped is done
 * in order to guaranty forward-compatibility.
 *
 * NOTE: The encoding format documented here must also be used by hard-coded documentation
 *       strings, such as found throughout the deemon core, as well as dex modules.
 *
 * NOTE: Unless otherwise noted, the BODY part of each of these can always contain other
 *       formating options recursively.
 *
 *
 *   - Headers
 *         #Hn{BODY}
 *         #HnBODY\n
 *             Where `n' is one of 1 2 3 4 5 or 6, and BODY is the text used as header.
 *
 *   - Emphasis/italics, Strong emphasis/bold and strikethrough
 *         #B{BODY}   Bold for BODY
 *         #BBODY     Bold for BODY; BODY starts with a issymstrt() character, and ends at the first !issymcont() char
 *         #I{BODY}   Italic for BODY
 *         #IBODY     Italic for BODY; BODY starts with a issymstrt() character, and ends at the first !issymcont() char
 *         #S{BODY}   Strikethrough for BODY
 *         #SBODY     Strikethrough for BODY; BODY starts with a issymstrt() character, and ends at the first !issymcont() char
 *
 *   - Lists
 *         #L-{BODY1|BODY2|BODY3}
 *         #L+{BODY1|BODY2|BODY3}
 *         #L*{BODY1|BODY2|BODY3}
 *         #L{{1.}BODY1|{2.}BODY2|{3.}BODY3}
 *             Syntax:
 *               - List lines are separated by |-characters
 *               - The list element character is written after the #L and before the {
 *               - When no element character is given, a per-item character can instead
 *                 be given by having list elements start with {ELEM_PREFIX}
 *
 *   - Hyper-links
 *         #A{BODY|LINK}
 *             Syntax:
 *               - The LINK text is not processed recursively, but is the actual
 *                 hyper-link location (with things like |-characters escaped as #|)
 *               - BODY will be clickable to go the given indicated link, and is
 *                 processed recursively for more format specifiers
 *
 *
 *   - Inline code (with- and without deemon syntax highlighting)
 *         #C{BODY}           - BODY is high-lit as abstract code
 *         #C[deemon]{BODY}   - BODY is high-lit as deemon code
 *         #CBODY             - Same as #C{BODY}, but BODY is must start with issymstrt() and ends on the first !issymcont()
 *         #C[deemon]BODY     - Same as #C[deemon]{BODY}, but BODY is must start with issymstrt() and ends on the first !issymcont()
 *         ${BODY}            - Same as #C[deemon]{BODY}
 *         $BODY              - Same as #C[deemon]BODY
 *             Syntax:
 *               - More language-specific highlighting may be supported by doc text renderers
 *                 than only the anonymous code renderer, and the deemon code renderer. To
 *                 ensure forward compatibility, unknown languages such as #C[bash]{echo Hello}
 *                 should be high-lit the same way as #C{echo Hello}, meaning that unknown names
 *                 should appear as abstract code
 *               - The $BODY form accepts the following strings for BODY:
 *                 - $foo    -- symstrt + symcont...                       (Symbol name)
 *                 - $1.2    -- decimal + (decimal | '.')...               (Integer or float constant)
 *                 - $-1.2   -- ('-' | '+') + decimal + (decimal | '.')... (Integer or float constant)
 *                 - $"foo"  -- '"' + (('\\' any) | (any & !'"')) + '"'    (String constant)
 *                 - $'foo'  -- '\'' + (('\\' any) | (any & !'\'')) + '\'' (String constant)
 *                 - $r"foo" -- 'r' + '"' + (any & !'"') + '"'             (Raw string constant)
 *                 - $r'foo' -- 'r' + '\'' + (any & !'\'') + '\''          (Raw string constant)
 *
 *   - Tables
 *         #T{BODY11|BODY12|BODY13~BODY21|BODY22|BODY23&BODY31|BODY32|BODY33}
 *             Produced list (approximation)
 *                  +========+========+========+
 *                  | BODY11 | BODY12 | BODY13 |
 *                  +========+========+========+
 *                  | BODY21 | BODY22 | BODY23 |
 *                  +--------+--------+--------+
 *                  | BODY31 | BODY32 | BODY33 |
 *                  +========+========+========+
 *             Syntax:
 *               - #T{ begins the list and } ends the list
 *               - Cells are filled left->right, top->bottom
 *               - The next horizontal cells is started with a |-character
 *               - The next line is started by a...
 *                  - ... ~-character for a thick line
 *                  - ... &-character for a thin line
 *               - A list where certain lines contain a different # of cells than other lines
 *                 that came before or come after is encoded, rendering that list causes weak
 *                 undefined behavior, in that it is up to the renderer what to do with superfluous
 *                 cells, or cells that are missing.
 *               - At the start of a cell, an additional {...} block may be placed where ...
 *                 is a comma-separated list of additional renderer options. - The following
 *                 list of options is recognized:
 *                 - tl, t, tr, l, c, r, bl, b, br -- Set the alignment of the cell's contents. (default: tl)
 *                 - ...                           -- Any other rendering option should silently
 *                                                    by ignored by the rendering engine in order
 *                                                    to allow for forward-compatibility with
 *                                                    future options.
 *
 *   - Symbol references
